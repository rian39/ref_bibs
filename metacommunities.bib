  abstract = {Because they are right under our nose, taken-for-granted, and essential to every person everywhere, personal names have often eluded the theoretical and analytical scrutiny they deserve. To what extent do naming practices exemplify or parallel the biopolitics of bodily inscriptions and markings such as tattoos, birthmarks, and presumed racial signatures? To what extent do names represent “technologies of the self” (Foucault 1988) in the broadest sense, as both means of domination and empowerment, facilitating collective surveillance and subjugation, and the individual fashioning of identity and subjectivity? Partly drawing upon indigenous contexts in the North American Arctic (Inuit and Yup’ik), this commentary discusses personal names and genealogies in relation to other technologies of belonging. Practices of naming, it is argued, are not only key elements of identification and personhood, embodied in the biosocial habitus much like other biomarkers, also they situate people in genealogies, social networks, and states. Clashes, I suggest, between different traditions and practices of naming, especially in the context of slavery and empires, illuminate with striking clarity the relevance of names as technologies of exclusion, subjugation, and belonging.},

  abstract = {The concept of machine space translates the hitherto aspatial phenomenon of technology into an explicitly spatial one in order to encourage recognition of the territorial demands involved in the growth of technology. Machine space is found where machines have priority over people in the use of territory. The exponential growth of technology on a finite earth has created a series of conflicts between people and machines. These conflicts arise when human purposes contradict human consequences of technological growth. Three aspects of this contradictory relationship revealed by an examination of machine space are use rights, the nature of control, and the deadly quality of such space both in human and in ecological terms. Nontechnological spatial antidotes, including the containment or reversal of machine space, are discussed in a framework of advocacy geography. Empirical analysis focuses on the automobile in urban locations in the United States.},

  abstract = {How to address empirically the calculative character of markets without dissolving it? In our paper, we propose a theoretical framework that helps to deal with markets without suspending their calculative properties. In the first section, we construct a broad definition of calculation, grounded on the anthropology of science and techniques. In the next sections, we apply this definition to three constitutive elements of markets: economic goods, economic agents and economic exchanges. First, we examine the question of the calculability of goods: in order to be calculated, goods must be calculable. In the following section, we introduce the notion of calculative distributed agencies to understand how these calculable goods are actually calculated. Thirdly, we consider the rules and material devices that organize the encounter between (and aggregation of) individual supplies and demands, i.e. the specific organizations that allow for a calculated exchange and a market output. Those three elements define concrete markets as collective organized devices that calculate compromises on the values of goods. In each, we encounter different versions of our broad definition of calculation, which we illustrate with examples, mainly taken from the fields of financial markets and mass retail.},

Developed in post-War Europe, these theories are often applied in ways that lack transferability to situations where infrastructure conditions are precarious and hybrid. This article seeks to broaden these theories by relating them to infrastructure challenges common to the South, drawing in particular on prevalent issues in water supply. Such engagement helps to identify shortcomings in these theories, to push their paradigms further, and to raise new questions related to infrastructure configuration, stability, and transition. As such, the study of sociotechnical systems across a range of contexts can be enriched. In particular, this article extends theory by placing coexistence among sociotechnical systems, as opposed to the universality of a single dominant infrastructure network, at the center of enquiry. Recognizing coexistence is important because it enables one to decouple key concepts in STS from the presumption of universalized and uniform networks, enabling them to become relevant for the South. Examples discussed in this essay include stability or “momentum” and transitions.},

On the basis of fieldwork conducted in the United States, Europe, and India, I argue that geeks imagine their social existence and relations as much through technical practices (hacking, networking, and code writing) as through discursive argument (rights, identities, and relations). In addition, they consider a “right to tinker” a form of free speech that takes the form of creating, implementing, modifying, or using specific kinds of software (especially Free Software) rather than verbal discourse.},

In this introductory essay we point to four formulations in STS for the relation between the conceptual and the empirical which do not figure them as binaries or opposites: (1) the empirical as a path to the conceptual, (2) the conceptual as practical and empirical, (3) the empirical as an instantiation of the conceptual (and the dangers of that view), and (4) a conceptual minimalism. We then point to some inspirations in contemporary thought for engaging creatively with the conceptual and empirical, and conclude by summarizing the contributions to this issue.},

In this article, we discuss how the Semantic Web, an enabling technology for these emerging source code analysis domains, can support a standardized, formal, and semantic rich representation to model these corpora. We also illustrate how inference services can be used to provide support for emerging source code analysis approaches on this data, such as search, call graph construction, and clone detection.},

We propose a set of lightweight techniques that may scale up to very large amounts of source code in the presence of multiple versions. The common idea behind these techniques is to use bad hashing to get a quick answer. We report on a case study, the Squeaksource ecosystem, which features thousands of software projects, with more than 40 million versions of methods, across more than seven years of evolution.

This paper explores which elements can be considered to characterize the reproducibility of a study in this area, and how they can be analyzed to better understand the type of reproduction studies they enable or obstruct. One of the main results of this exploration is the need of a systematic approach to asses the reproducibility of a study, due to the complexity of the processes usually involved, and the many details to be taken into account. To address this need, a methodology for assessing the reproducibility of studies is also presented and discussed, as a tool to help to raise awareness about research reproducibility in this field. The application of the methodology in practice has shown how, even for papers aimed to be reproducible, a systematic analysis raises important aspects that render reproduction difficult or impossible. We also show how, by identifying elements and attributes related to reproducibility, it can be better understood which kind of reproduction can be done for a specific study, given the description of datasets, methodologies and parameters it uses.},

A combination of factors is driving this momentum, including the contributions made by hundreds of developers and the leading role played by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo), aiming primarily to support and promote the collaborative development of open source geospatial technologies and data. This article seeks to map out the social history of collaborative activities within the OSGeo ecosystem. We used the archival logs of developers' contributions, specifically looking for boundary spanning activities where contributions crossed multiple projects. The analysis and visualization of these activities allow us to have a better understanding of the role of boundary spanning in the resourcing of each project, the incubation mechanism advocated by OSGeo, and the significance of the social interrelatedness among projects. The data consisted of the subversion (SVN) commit history made by individual developers in the programming code repository. We applied several network analytical and visualization techniques to explore the data. Our findings indicate that more than one in seven developers spanned multiple projects which potentially had the effects of shaping the projects' directions, and increased knowledge flow and innovation. In addition, the OSGeo's incubation mechanism provided an important encouragement for boundary spanning and increased knowledge sharing. By studying the social history of contributions, further tools can be developed in future to assist tracking of the social history, and make developers mindful of the significance of the interdependence among projects and hence continuously contribute to the health of the OSGeo ecosystem.},

The framework consists of the SMIILE tool for calculation of software metrics, extended with an analysis of software structure. The data are stored in a central repository via enriched Concrete Syntax Tree (eCST) for universal source code representation. The framework is demonstrated in a case study. The development of such a framework is a step forward to consistent support for software evolution by providing a change analysis and quality control. The significance of this consistency is growing today, when software projects are more complex, consisting of components developed in diverse programming languages.},

It was so simplified that it omitted important cases from the analysis, and would lead researchers to wrong conclusions. In this research, we propose an algorithm to overcome the problem.

  abstract = {Up-to-date preservation of project knowledge like developer communication and design documents is essential for the successful evolution of software systems. Ideally, all knowledge should be preserved, but since projects only have limited resources, and software systems continuously grow in scope and complexity, one needs to prioritize the subsystems and development periods for which knowledge preservation is more urgent. For example, core subsystems on which the majority of other subsystems build are obviously prime candidates for preservation, yet if these subsystems change continuously, picking a development period to start knowledge preservation and to maintain knowledge for over time become very hard. This paper exploits the time dependence between code changes to automatically determine for which subsystems and development periods of a software project knowledge preservation would be most valuable. A case study on two large open source projects (PostgreSQL and FreeBSD) shows that the most valuable subsystems to preserve knowledge for are large core subsystems. However, the majority of these subsystems (1) are continuously foundational, i.e., ideally for each development period knowledge should be preserved, and (2) experience substantial changes, i.e., preserving knowledge requires substantial effort.

However, existing approaches and platforms for MSR analysis face many challenges when performing large-scale MSR studies. Such approaches and platforms rarely scale easily out of the box. Instead, they often require custom scaling tricks and designs that are costly to maintain and that are not reusable for other types of analysis. We believe that the web community has faced many of these software engineering scaling challenges before, as web analyses have to cope with the enormous growth of web data. In this paper, we report on our experience in using a web-scale platform (i.e., Pig) as a data preparation language to aid large-scale MSR studies. Through three case studies, we carefully validate the use of this web platform to prepare (i.e., Extract, Transform, and Load, ETL) data for further analysis. Despite several limitations, we still encourage MSR researchers to leverage Pig in their large-scale studies because of Pig's scalability and flexibility. Our experience report will help other researchers who want to scale their analyses. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Empirical research on Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) has shown that developers tend to cluster around two main roles: "core" contributors differ from "peripheral" developers in terms of a larger number of responsibilities and a higher productivity pattern. A further, cross-cutting characterization of developers could be achieved by associating developers with "time slots", and different patterns of activity and effort could be associated to such slots. Such analysis, if replicated, could be used not only to compare different FLOSS communities, and to evaluate their stability and maturity, but also to determine within projects, how the effort is distributed in a given period, and to estimate future needs with respect to key points in the software life-cycle (e.g., major releases). This study analyses the activity patterns within the Linux kernel project, at first focusing on the overall distribution of effort and activity within weeks and days; then, dividing each day into three 8-hour time slots, and focusing on effort and activity around major releases. Such analyses have the objective of evaluating effort, productivity and types of activity globally and around major releases. They enable a comparison of these releases and patterns of effort and activities with traditional software products and processes, and in turn, the identification of company-driven projects (i.e., working mainly during office hours) among FLOSS endeavors. The results of this research show that, overall, the effort within the Linux kernel community is constant (albeit at different levels) throughout the week, signalling the need of updated estimation models, different from those used in traditional 9am-5pm, Monday to Friday commercial companies. It also becomes evident that the activity before a release is vastly different from after a release, and that the changes show an increase in code complexity in specific time slots (notably in the late night hours), which will later require additional maintenance efforts.},

  abstract = {Open source software development is becoming always more relevant. Understanding the behavior of developers in open source software projects and identifying the kinds of their contributions is an essential step to improve the efficiency of the development process and to organize the development teams more effectively. Moreover, understanding the level of participation of the different developers helps to understand which members of the development team are more important than others and who are the actual key developers. This paper investigates the behavior of open source developers and the structure of the development of open source projects through the analysis of a very large dataset: 10 well-known and widely used open source software projects for a total of more than 4 MLOC (millions of lines of code) modified distributed in more than 200 K versions. This study builds on the top of other studies in this area applying a set of rigorous statistical techniques, analyzing how developers contribute to the projects. Its novelty is in the fine gain analysis of the developers that have commit rights on the repository of the project they work on, in the automated identification of key contributors of the project, in the size of the analyzed datasets, and in the statistical techniques used to classify the behavior of the developers in an automated way. To collect such large volume of data and to ensure their integrity, a tool to automatically mine open source version control systems has been used. The main result of this study is the identification of a recurrent pattern of four kinds of contributors with the same characteristics in all the projects analyzed even if the projects are very different in domain, size, language, etc. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Correcting software defects accounts for a significant amount of resources in a software project. To make best use of testing efforts, researchers have studied statistical models to predict in which parts of a software system future defects are likely to occur. By studying the mathematical relations between predictor variables used in these models, researchers can form an increased understanding of the important connections between development activities and software quality. Predictor variables used in past top-performing models are largely based on source code-oriented metrics, such as lines of code or number of changes. However, source code is the end product of numerous interlaced and collaborative activities carried out by developers. Traces of such activities can be found in the various repositories used to manage development efforts. In this paper, we develop statistical models to study the impact of social interactions in a software project on software quality. These models use predictor variables based on social information mined from the issue tracking and version control repositories of two large open-source software projects. The results of our case studies demonstrate the impact of metrics from four different dimensions of social interaction on post-release defects. Our findings show that statistical models based on social information have a similar degree of explanatory power as traditional models. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that social information does not substitute, but rather augments traditional source code-based metrics used in defect prediction models.},

  abstract = {Some approaches have been used to investigate evidence on how developers refactor their code, whether refactorings activities may decrease the number of bugs, or improve developers' productivity. However, there are some contradicting evidence in previous studies. For instance, some investigations found evidence that if the number of refactoring changes increases in the preceding time period the number of defects decreases, different from other studies. They have used different approaches to evaluate refactoring activities. Some of them identify committed behavior-preserving transformations in software repositories by using manual analysis, commit messages, or dynamic analysis. Others focus on identifying which refactorings are applied between two programs by using manual inspection or static analysis. In this work, we compare three different approaches based on manual analysis, commit message (Ratzinger's approach) and dynamic analysis (SAFEREFACTOR'S approach) to detect whether a pair of versions determines a refactoring, in terms of behavioral preservation. Additionally, we compare two approaches (manual analysis and REF-FINDER) to identify which refactorings are performed in each pair of versions. We perform both comparisons by evaluating their accuracy, precision, and recall in a randomly selected sample of 40 pairs of versions of JHotDraw, and 20 pairs of versions of Apache Common Collections. While the manual analysis presents the best results in both comparisons, it is not as scalable as the automated approaches. Ratzinger's approach is simple and fast, but presents a low recall; differently, SAFEREFACTOR is able to detect most applied refactorings, although limitations in its test generation backend results for some kinds of subjects in low precision values. REF-FINDER presented a low precision and recall in our evaluation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In August 2002 three Indian computer scientists published a paper entitled 'PRIMES is in P' online. It presents a 'deterministic algorithm' which determines in 'polynomial time' if a given number is a prime number. The story was quickly picked up by the general press, and by this means spread through the scientific community of complexity theorists, where it was hailed as a major theoretical breakthrough. This is despite scientists regarding the media reports as vulgar popularizations. When the paper was published in a peer-reviewed journal only l years later, the three scientists had already received wide recognition for their accomplishment. Current sociological theory challenges the ability to clearly distinguish on independent epistemic grounds between distorted and non-distorted scientific knowledge. It views the demarcation lines between such forms of presentation as contextual and unstable. In my paper, I challenge this view. By systematically surveying the popular press coverage of the 'PRIMES is in P' affair, I argue-against the prevailing new orthodoxy-that distorted simplifications of scientific knowledge are distinguishable from non-distorted simplifications on independent epistemic grounds. I argue that in the 'PRIMES is in P' affair, the three scientists could ride on the wave of the general press-distorted coverage of their algorithm, while counting on their colleagues' ability to distinguish genuine accounts from distorted ones. Thus, their scientific reputation was unharmed. This suggests that the possibility of the existence of independent epistemic standards must be incorporated into the new SSK model of popularization.},

American Men of Science was a collection of biographical sketches of thousands of men of science in the USA and was published periodically. It launched, and was used in, the very first systematic quantitative studies on science. Cattell used two concepts for his statistics: productivity, defined as the number of men of science a nation produces, and performance or merit, defined as scientific contributions to research as judged by peers. These are the two dimensions that still define measurement of scientific productivity today: quantity and quality. This paper analyzes the emergence of statistics on science and the very first uses to which they were put. It argues that the measurement of science emerged out of interest in great men, heredity and eugenics, and the contribution of eminent men to civilization. Among these eminent men were men of science, the population of whom was thought to be in decline and insufficiently appreciated and supported. Statistics on men of science thus came to be collected to document the case, and to contribute to the advancement of science and the scientific profession.},

By way of a case-study of Klout, an influential measure of influence, we suggest that the forms of reactivity and self-fulfilling prophecy that have been identified as a problem with some forms of measurement are actually an intentional effect of such tools: that is, the measurements that such tools produce are not designed to capture a separate reality, but are deliberately employed to modify the activity that they themselves invite. In other words, they expect and exploit reactivity. We suggest that such media are indicative of the rise in what might be called participative metrics of value. We further suggest that the capacity to evaluate and modify the self that Klout affords is intricately tied up with the agency and (self-)valuation of Klout as a tool itself. An intermediate layer of the argument is that this tying up is achieved through the production of numbers as specific kinds of ‘enumerated entities’. We use this term to draw attention to the ways in which numbers are never simply abstractions, but always have specific material-semiotic properties. In this case, we show that these properties are tied to the use of media-specific operations, and that these properties, including those of inclusion and belonging, inform how Klout participates in particular kinds of ordering and valuation. We thus explore the interlinked movement of numbers, media, and value in social media as a kind of dynamic assemblage.},

  abstract = {Indicators with long social histories, such as the Consumer Price Index, often serve as nodes of calculative infrastructures. They create a field of social action, making some relations between people, institutions, and materials possible, and other relations less possible. By reflecting on two experiments in do-it-yourself sensor data, this article explores the tensions that occur when indicators have not yet become stable entities. When the conditions of possibility for the indicator's continued existence are less assured, the labor it takes to build numbers into something socially meaningful becomes surprisingly visible. This labor proceeds in stops and starts, as the various material and epistemological and social resistances reveal themselves. Sensors shape these starts and stops. Sensors give their users an indication of a possible whole entity whose contents they cannot fully imagine, and either must create or abandon. Far from producing certainty, sensor data often provokes a sense of vagueness that is worked on until it becomes either clarity or action, failure or indifference. Through this view of numbers in the making, we can see just how remarkable it is that indicators become part of calculative infrastructures at all.},

  abstract = {As sequel to an earlier paper on ordinal ranking, this paper focuses on another old, but increasingly widespread, numerical expression, in both technical and public domains: namely, the percentage. It argues that the long and expanding genealogy of use, from descriptive to governmental to probabilistic, gives it persuasive as well as instrumental power, as people come to grips with novel terms of life by drawing on old concepts. The ‘one hundred’ offers a sense of understanding, while in public expressions, there appears to be an increasing vagueness of the specific nature of the one hundred as denominator and a new potential for one hundred to gesture towards an aspirational future rather than any simple description of the present. The second section engages with Helen Verran's approach to number, where she shows how numerical expressions can move from one mode to another through the possibility of expressing both one/many and part/whole relationships. The next section illustrates the applications of percentage in different domains of social life, particularly as proportion in governance (the tax regime) and political philosophy (Rawls on ‘fairness’), both of which orient instrumentally towards a future. The final section describes a current representation of the city of Baltimore in ordinals and percentages, oriented in more clearly expressive, aspirational terms, towards a future whose nature has become indeterminate. The conclusion reaffirms the importance of an ethnographic approach to widely used numerical forms, such as percentage, in all contexts, as they mediate public understanding and aspiration.},

Additionally, we found that commit comments written on Mondays tend to a more negative emotion.

  abstract = {This is a book about the computer revolution of the mid-twentieth century and the people who made it possible. Unlike most histories of computing, it is not a book about machines, inventors, or entrepreneurs. Instead, it tells the story of the vast but largely anonymous legions of computer specialists–programmers, systems analysts, and other software developers–who transformed the electronic computer from a scientific curiosity into the defining technology of the modern era. As the systems that they built became increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, these specialists became the focus of a series of critiques of the social and organizational impact of electronic computing. To many of their contemporaries, it seemed the "computer boys" were taking over, not just in the corporate setting, but also in government, politics, and society in general. In The Computer Boys Take Over, Nathan Ensmenger traces the rise to power of the computer expert in modern American society. His rich and nuanced portrayal of the men and women (a surprising number of the "computer boys" were, in fact, female) who built their careers around the novel technology of electronic computing explores issues of power, identity, and expertise that have only become more significant in our increasingly computerized society.In his recasting of the drama of the computer revolution through the eyes of its principle revolutionaries, Ensmenger reminds us that the computerization of modern society was not an inevitable process driven by impersonal technological or economic imperatives, but was rather a creative, contentious, and above all, fundamentally human development.},

Learners participate in communities of practitioners, moving toward full participation in the sociocultural practices of a community. Legitimate peripheral participation provides a way to speak about crucial relations between newcomers and oldtimers and about their activities, identities, artifacts, knowledge and practice. The communities discussed in the book are midwives, tailors, quartermasters, butchers, and recovering alcoholics, however, the process by which participants in those communities learn can be generalized to other social groups.},

But these results are by no means inevitable: a systematic campaign to protect the entrenched industrial information economy of the last century threatens the promise of today’s emerging networked information environment.In this comprehensive social theory of the Internet and the networked information economy, Benkler describes how patterns of information, knowledge, and cultural production are changing—and shows that the way information and knowledge are made available can either limit or enlarge the ways people can create and express themselves. He describes the range of legal and policy choices that confront us and maintains that there is much to be gained—or lost—by the decisions we make today.},

  shorttitle = {Machine {{Learning Methods Without Tears}}},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT Machine learning methods, a family of statistical techniques with origins in the field of artificial intelligence, are recognized as holding great promise for the advancement of understanding and prediction about ecological phenomena. These modeling techniques are flexible enough to handle complex problems with multiple interacting elements and typically outcompete traditional approaches (e.g., generalized linear models), making them ideal for modeling ecological systems. Despite their inherent advantages, a review of the literature reveals only a modest use of these approaches in ecology as compared to other disciplines. One potential explanation for this lack of interest is that machine learning techniques do not fall neatly into the class of statistical modeling approaches with which most ecologists are familiar. In this paper, we provide an introduction to three machine learning approaches that can be broadly used by ecologists: classification and regression trees, artificial neural networks, and evolutionary computation. For each approach, we provide a brief background to the methodology, give examples of its application in ecology, describe model development and implementation, discuss strengths and weaknesses, explore the availability of statistical software, and provide an illustrative example. Although the ecological application of machine learning approaches has increased, there remains considerable skepticism with respect to the role of these techniques in ecology. Our review encourages a greater understanding of machine learning approaches and promotes their future application and utilization, while also providing a basis from which ecologists can make informed decisions about whether to select or avoid these approaches in their future modeling endeavors.},

  abstract = {We present a study of the relationship between gender, linguistic style, and social networks, using a novel corpus of 14,000 users of Twitter. Prior quantitative work on gender often treats this social variable as a binary; we argue for a more nuanced approach. By clustering Twitter feeds, we find a range of styles and interests that reflects the multifaceted interaction between gender and language. Some styles mirror the aggregated language-gender statistics, while others contradict them. Next, we investigate individuals whose language better matches the other gender. We find that such individuals have social networks that include significantly more individuals from the other gender, and that in general, social network homophily is correlated with the use of same-gender language markers. Pairing computational methods and social theory thus offers a new perspective on how gender emerges as individuals position themselves relative to audiences, topics, and mainstream gender norms.},

This paper proposes a methodology for complex social simulations-particularly inter-and multidisciplinary socio-natural systems with multi-level architecture-based on a succession of models akin to but distinct from the late Imre Lakatos' notion of a 'research programme'. The proposed methodology is illustrated through examples from the Mason-Smithsonian project on agent-based models of the rise and fall of polities in Inner Asia. While the proposed methodology requires further development, so far it has proven valuable for advancing the scientific objectives of the project and avoiding some pitfalls.},

  abstract = {Purpose - Social media provide an impressive amount of data about users and their interactions, thereby offering computer and social scientists, economists, and statisticians - among others - new opportunities for research. Arguably, one of the most interesting lines of work is that of predicting future events and developments from social media data. However, current work is fragmented and lacks of widely accepted evaluation approaches. Moreover, since the first techniques emerged rather recently, little is known about their overall potential, limitations and general applicability to different domains. Therefore, better understanding the predictive power and limitations of social media is of utmost importance. Design/methodology/approach - Different types of forecasting models and their adaptation to the special circumstances of social media are analyzed and the most representative research conducted up to date is surveyed. Presentations of current research on techniques, methods, and empirical studies aimed at the prediction of future or current events from social media data are provided. Findings - A taxonomy of prediction models is introduced, along with their relative advantages and the particular scenarios where they have been applied to. The main areas of prediction that have attracted research so far are described, and the main contributions made by the papers in this special issue are summarized. Finally, it is argued that statistical models seem to be the most fruitful approach to apply to make predictions from social media data. Originality/value - This special issue raises important questions to be addressed in the field of social media-based prediction and forecasting, fills some gaps in current research, and outlines future lines of work.},

Complex contagions, unlike infectious diseases (simple contagions), are affected by social reinforcement and homophily. Hence, the spread within highly clustered communities is enhanced, while diffusion across communities is hampered. A common hypothesis is that memes and behaviors are complex contagions. We show that, while most memes indeed spread like complex contagions, a few viral memes spread across many communities, like diseases. We demonstrate that the future popularity of a meme can be predicted by quantifying its early spreading pattern in terms of community concentration. The more communities a meme permeates, the more viral it is. We present a practical method to translate data about community structure into predictive knowledge about what information will spread widely.

  abstract = {Use of socially generated "big data" to access information about collective states of the minds in human societies has become a new paradigm in the emerging field of computational social science. A natural application of this would be the prediction of the society's reaction to a new product in the sense of popularity and adoption rate. However, bridging the gap between "real time monitoring" and "early predicting" remains a big challenge. Here we report on an endeavor to build a minimalistic predictive model for the financial success of movies based on collective activity data of online users. We show that the popularity of a movie can be predicted much before its release by measuring and analyzing the activity level of editors and viewers of the corresponding entry to the movie in Wikipedia, the well-known online encyclopedia.},

  abstract = {The WikiLeaks Afghanistan war logs contain nearly 77,000 reports of incidents in the US-led Afghanistan war, covering the period from January 2004 to December 2009. The recent growth of data on complex social systems and the potential to derive stories from them has shifted the focus of journalistic and scientific attention increasingly toward data-driven journalism and computational social science. In this paper we advocate the usage of modern statistical methods for problems of data journalism and beyond, which may help journalistic and scientific work and lead to additional insight. Using the WikiLeaks Afghanistan war logs for illustration, we present an approach that builds intelligible statistical models for interpretable segments in the data, in this case to explore the fatality rates associated with different circumstances in the Afghanistan war. Our approach combines preprocessing by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with model trees. LDA is used to process the natural language information contained in each report summary by estimating latent topics and assigning each report to one of them. Together with other variables these topic assignments serve as splitting variables for finding segments in the data to which local statistical models for the reported number of fatalities are fitted. Segmentation and fitting is carried out with recursive partitioning of negative binomial distributions. We identify segments with different fatality rates that correspond to a small number of topics and other variables as well as their interactions. Furthermore, we carve out the similarities between segments and connect them to stories that have been covered in the media. This gives an unprecedented description of the war in Afghanistan and serves as an example of how data journalism, computational social science and other areas with interest in database data can benefit from modern statistical techniques.},

  abstract = {Modeling real-world scenarios is a challenge for traditional social science researchers, as it is often hard to capture the intricacies and dynamisms of real-world situations without making simplistic assumptions. This imposes severe limitations on the capabilities of such models and frameworks. Complex population dynamics during natural disasters such as pandemics is an area where computational social science can provide useful insights and explanations. In this paper, we employ a novel intent-driven modeling paradigm for such real-world scenarios by causally mapping beliefs, goals, and actions of individuals and groups to overall behavior using a probabilistic representation called Bayesian Knowledge Bases (BKBs). To validate our framework we examine emergent behavior occurring near a national border during pandemics, specifically the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Mexico. The novelty of the work in this paper lies in representing the dynamism at multiple scales by including both coarse-grained (events at the national level) and fine-grained (events at two separate border locations) information. This is especially useful for analysts in disaster management and first responder organizations who need to be able to understand both macro-level behavior and changes in the immediate vicinity, to help with planning, prevention, and mitigation. We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework in uncovering previously hidden connections and explanations by comparing independent models of the border locations with their fused model to identify emergent behaviors not found in either independent location models nor in a simple linear combination of those models.},

However, what researchers know, and with whom they collaborate, could be transformed through the strategic use of advances designed to support research, defined here as 'research-centred computational networks'. This article presents a framework for conceptualizing the social and technological choices shaping the next generation of research in ways that could open democratize key aspects of the research process that move well beyond academic publication. The framework highlights the limited scope of innovation to date, and identifies a variety of factors that maintain and enhance institutional control over the research process, at the risk of losing the creative and productive bottom-up participation by networked researchers and citizen researchers among the public at large. Conceptualizing, prioritizing and advancing study of next generation research is one of the most significant but difficult challenges facing scholars of information technology.

SimPol demonstrates that computational models of entire political systems are methodologically feasible and scientifically viable; they can also build on and progress beyond previous theory and research to advance our understanding of how polities operate across a variety of domains (simple vs. complex) and levels of analysis (local, national, international). Both simple and realistic models are necessary, for theoretical and empirical purposes, respectively.},

In this article we explore empirically how the modernist framing of Bourdieu’s aesthetics needs to be rethought in the context of contemporary aesthetic change. Drawing on a survey of museum visitors in Ghent, Belgium (n = 1195), we use Multiple Correspondence Analysis to analyse what aesthetic dimensions are important when people contemplate works of art. We find that the familiar Bourdieusian opposition between popular (based on beauty and harmony) and highbrow aesthetics is still important. However, the content of highbrow aesthetics has changed, now privileging ‘postmodernist’ dimensions over modernist ones. We can also detect another dimension that favours a socially reflexive art compared to a detachment of art from social preoccupations, which is not recognized in Bourdieu’s account.},

  abstract = {The aim of the article is to intervene in debates about the digital and, in particular, framings that imagine the digital in terms of epochal shifts or as redefining life. Instead, drawing on recent developments in digital methods, we explore the lively, productive and performative qualities of the digital by attending to the specificities of digital devices and how they interact, and sometimes compete, with older devices and their capacity to mobilize and materialize social and other relations. In doing so, our aim is to explore the implications of digital devices and data for reassembling social science methods or what we call the social science apparatuses that assemble digital devices and data to ‘know’ the social and other relations. Building on recent work at CRESC on the social life of methods, we recommend a genealogical approach that is alive to the ways in which digital devices are simultaneously shaped by social worlds, and can in turn become agents that shape those worlds. This calls for attending to the specificities of digital devices themselves, how they are varied and composed of diverse socio-technical arrangements, and are enrolled in the creation of new knowledge spaces, institutions and actors. Rather than exploring what large-scale changes can be revealed and understood through the digital, we argue for explorations of how digital devices themselves are materially implicated in the production and performance of contemporary sociality. To that end we offer the following nine propositions about the implications of digital data and devices and argue that these demand rethinking the theoretical assumptions of social science methods: transactional actors; heterogeneity; visualization; continuous time; whole populations; granularity; expertise; mobile and mobilizing; and non-coherence.},

Today this is changing. Trends such as Ethical Consumerism and Corporate Social Responsibility are on the rise. More fundamentally, the economic importance of intangible assets like brands has increased. Together these developments testify to a new role for a wider range of values in determining price formation. In this paper I will argue that this trend has two principal causes. First, the socialization of production has increased the importance of affective investments in things like brands, reputation, corporate culture and efficient teamwork as sources of value. Second, a common criterion for the measurement of affective investments is forming, based on the new abstract or General Sentiment that is emerging as a new ‘general equivalent’ as a consequence of the present remediation of communicative relations, primarily throughout the diffusion of social media. Together these two dimensions make up the foundations for a new value logic, an ‘ethical economy’ that is emerging within contemporary wealth creation. After briefly summarizing the first argument, this paper will concentrate on the second, describing the emergence and features of General Sentiment as a criterion of value. The conclusion will suggest possible consequences of this development in both practical and theoretical terms.},

However, how this distribution arises has not been conclusively demonstrated in direct analyses of people's actions in social networks. Here, we perform a causal inference analysis and find an underlying cause for this phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that heavy-tailed degree distribution is causally determined by similarly skewed distribution of human activity. Specifically, the degree of an individual is entirely random - following a “maximum entropy attachment” model - except for its mean value which depends deterministically on the volume of the users' activity. This relation cannot be explained by interactive models, like preferential attachment, since the observed actions are not likely to be caused by interactions with other people.},

  abstract = {Zero-priced goods (which we call ‘free stuff’) are an overlooked foundation of privilege. From corporate perks to meal accoutrements and easy access to bathrooms, free stuff does work of a number of important types, from easing everyday personal routine to solidifying economic ties. We trace the flow of free stuff using an ‘affordance’ perspective on privilege, a useful way to examine the micro-situational foundations of inequality. This perspective focuses attention on exactly how resources, from cash to cultural capital, are made useful in day-to-day life. We examine the transaction of freebies in three ideal-typical networks: that of the professional, the culture industry broker, and the poor urban dweller. Through comparison of each of these cases, we argue that freebies and perks are affordances of class position, whether in their abundance, as in the case of the professional's ease with perks, or in their absence in the case of poor people's subsistence. Free stuff can be an important medium of exchange in a number of worlds, and often serves to seamlessly provide recipients with important situational resources. The poor, however, are often left out of valuable networks of exchange, thus facing considerable retrieval costs for free stuff others take for granted.},

  abstract = {The discussion in the sociology of science about the role of model systems in biology provides an invitation to reflect on whether and how similar devices operate in sociology. This paper shows that sociology relies on objects of study that receive a disproportionate amount of attention and implicitly come to stand in for a specific class of objects. But, unlike other disciplines, sociology has no agreed language or theory to classify the discipline-specific objects that it studies, which hinders explicit reflection on the use of model systems across sociological subfields. In contrast to other disciplines, which use model systems, physical copies of sociological model systems usually do not travel. Because of this, the relationship between specimen and epistemic object is less standardised in sociology than in other disciplines, which creates problems for the accumulation of knowledge. Sociology also encounters unique problems of access to model systems.},

  abstract = {Economic sociology has been preoccupied with the institution of markets, to the relative neglect of ownership. It has inherited certain technical and governmental problematics regarding that which can or cannot be internalised within the market price system, leading to the assumption that the ‘social’ or the ‘public’ is a type of empirical externality. But by shifting attention towards institutions of ownership, the public and the private come to appear as primarily normative appeals, used to challenge and justify the drawing of boundaries in economic life. Boundaries are judged for their justice, as well as for their empirical efficacy. Adopting a pragmatist approach, this paper outlines three possible ‘orders of appropriation’ which can be appealed to when justifying and criticising privatisation in economic situations: the socialist, the neoliberal and the liberal. Beyond any scientific or technical account of property, each of these offers an ‘ultimate’ basis on which to view ownership, according to different and incompatible philosophical anthropologies.},

  abstract = {Topic modeling provides a valuable method for identifying the linguistic contexts that surround social institutions or policy domains. This article uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to analyze how one such policy domain, government assistance to artists and arts organizations, was framed in almost 8000 articles. These comprised all articles that referred to government support for the arts in the U.S. published in five U.S. newspapers between 1986 and 1997—a period during which such assistance, once noncontroversial, became a focus of contention. We illustrate the strengths of topic modeling as a means of analyzing large text corpora, discuss the proper choice of models and interpretation of model results, describe means of validating topic-model solutions, and demonstrate the use of topic models in combination with other statistical tools to estimate differences between newspapers in the prevalence of different frames. Throughout, we emphasize affinities between the topic-modeling approach and such central concepts in the study of culture as framing, polysemy, heteroglossia, and the relationality of meaning.},

Ilya Grigorik recently released a project called GitHub Archive. GitHub Archive is a project to record the public GitHub timeline, archive it, and make it easily accessible for further analysis. Analyze GitHub Data with Google BigQuery We are happy to announce that the GitHub public timeline is now a featured public dataset available on Google BigQuery, which launched to the public today. Running queries against the GitHub dataset is free. After logging into BigQuery, add the project name "githubarchive". Bonus Dataset: Programming Language Correlations This dataset, available in the language\_correlation table on BigQuery, explores the relationships between programming languages as seen by GitHub. Example: How likely is it that a programmer who writes in Objective-C also programs in Java? (31\%). Read on to learn more about how this data was gathered. Generals in the Editor War may note that Emacs users are 35.2\% likely to also hack on Vim, while Vim users are only 17.3\% likely to hack on Emacs, so there's that.},

Following a critique of the use of the notion of sharing by social network sites, the article concludes by suggesting affinities between sharing in Web 2.0 and in other social spheres.},

On the other hand, participation in StackOverflow may interrupt the regular working rhythm of the developer, hence also possibly slow down the development process. In this paper we investigate the interplay between StackOverflow activities and the development process, reflected by code changes committed to the largest social coding repository, GitHub. Our study shows that active GitHub committers ask fewer questions and provide more answers than others. Moreover, we observe that active StackOverflow askers distribute their work in a less uniform way than developers that do not ask questions. Finally, we show that despite the interruptions incurred, the StackOverflow activity rate correlates with the code changing activity in GitHub.},

However, current tendencies in the application of Global Software Engineering and Global Software Development, which forces geographically dispersed teams to collaborate, make the usual monitoring techniques obsolete. This situation has led to looking for new methods that can help in the decision making process, such as the case of the Social Network Analysis field. In this article we propose the introduction of Sentiment Analysis techniques in order to identify and monitor the underlying sentiments in the text written by developers in issues and tickets. Therefore, in order to check its viability we conducted an exploratory case study analysing polarity and emotional clues in development issues from nine well-known projects that are freely available. Results show that although both polarity and emotional analysis are applicable, the emotional analysis looks to be more suitable to this kind of corpus. The developers leave underlying sentiments in the text, and that information could be monitored as any other feature in the development process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We find that projects in which member PRs are more frequently merged with the codebase experience more sustained participation. We also find that projects with higher success rates among contributors and higher contributor retention tend to have more distributed (non-centralized) practices for reviewing and processing PRs. The relationships between organizational form and GitHub practices are enabled and made visible as a result of GitHub's novel interface. Our results demonstrate specific dimensions along which these projects differ and explicate a framework that warrants testing in future studies of OSS, particularly GitHub.},

GitHub portal is an online social network that supports development of software by virtual teams of programmers. Since there is no central mechanism that governs the process of team formation, it is interesting to investigate if there are any significant correlations between project quality and the characteristics of the team members. However, for such analysis to be possible, we need good metrics of a project quality. This paper develops two such metrics, first one reflecting project's popularity, and the second one - the quality of support offered by team members to users. The first metric is based on the number of 'stars' a project is given by other GitHub members, the second is obtained using survival analysis techniques applied to issues reported on the project by its users. After developing the metrics we have gathered characteristics of several GitHub projects and analyzed their influence on the project quality using statistical regression techniques.},

Our study shows that GitHub could handle hundreds of thousands of requests a day for all the projects and thousands of requests for one project. This capability of GitHub makes it suitable for supporting distributed software development.},

Who, however, cares about filing issues? What kind of issues are reported in issue trackers? What kind of correlation exist between issue reporting and the success of software projects? In this study, we address the need for answering such questions by performing an empirical study on a hundred thousands of open source projects. After filtering relevant trackers, the study used about 20,000 projects. We investigate and answer various research questions on the popularity and impact of issue trackers.},

  shorttitle = {Mining {{GitHub}}},
  abstract = {Using the freeware in GitHub, we are often confused by a phenomenon: the new version of GitHub freeware usually was released in an indefinite frequency; and developers often committed nothing for a long time. This evolution phenomenon interferes with our own development plan and architecture design. Why do these updates happen at that time? Can we predict GitHub software version evolution by developers' activities? This paper aims to explore the developer commit patterns in GitHub, and try to mine the relationship between these patterns (if exists) and code evolution. First, we define four metrics to measure commit activity and code evolution: the changes in each commit; the time between two commits; the author of each changes; and the source code dependency. Then, we adopt visualization techniques to explore developers' commit activity and code evolution. Visual techniques are used to describe the progress of the given project and the authors' contributions. To analyze the commit logs in GitHub software repository automatically, Commits Analysis Tool (CAT) is designed and implemented. Finally, eight open source projects in GitHub are analyzed using CAT, and we find that: 1) the file changes in the previous versions may affect the file depend on it in the next version; 2) the average days around "huge commit" is 3 times of that around normal commit. Using these two patterns and developer's commit model, we can predict when his next commit comes and which file may be changed in that commit. Such information is valuable for project planning of both GitHub projects and other projects which use GitHub freeware to develop software.},

  abstract = {Helen Verran uses the term relational empiricism' to describe situated empirical inquiry that is attentive to the relations that constitute its objects of study, including the investigator's own practices. Relational empiricism draws on and reconfigures Science and Technology Studies' traditional concerns with reflexivity and relationality, casting empirical inquiry as an important and non-innocent world-making practice. Through a reading of Verran's postcolonial projects in Nigeria and Australia, this article develops a concept of empirical and political accountability' to complement her relational empiricism. In Science and an African Logic, Verran provides accounts of the relations that materialize her empirical objects. These accounts work to decompose her original objects, generating new objects that are more promising for the specific postcolonial contexts of her work. The process of decomposition is part of remaining accountable for her research methods and accountable to the worlds she is working in and writing about. This is a practice of narrating relations and learning to tell better technoscientific stories. What counts as better, however, is not given, but is always contextual and at stake. In this way, Verran acts not as participant-observer, but as participant-storyteller, telling stories to facilitate epistemic flourishing within and as part of a historically located community of practice. The understanding of accountability that emerges from this discussion is designed as a contribution, both practical and evocative, to the theoretical toolkit of Science and Technology Studies scholars who are interested in thinking concretely about how we can be more accountable to the worlds we study.},

The results based on data collected from the DVD version of the 2011 SCI database identify the U.S. as the most central country, followed by the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Australia, the Netherlands, Canada, and Spain, in that order. However, some countries (e.g., Portugal) with low degree centrality occupied relatively central positions in terms of betweenness centrality. The results of the semantic network analysis suggest that internationally co-authored papers tend to focus on primary technologies, particularly in terms of programming and related database issues. The results show that a combination of words and locations can provide a richer representation of an emerging field of science than the sum of the two separate representations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {What counts? In work, as in other areas of life, it is not always clear what standards we are being judged by or how our worth is being determined. This can be disorienting and disconcerting. Because of this, many organizations devote considerable resources to limiting and clarifying the logics used for evaluating worth. But as David Stark argues, firms would often be better off, especially in managing change, if they allowed multiple logics of worth and did not necessarily discourage uncertainty. In fact, in many cases multiple orders of worth are unavoidable, so organizations and firms should learn to harness the benefits of such "heterarchy" rather than seeking to purge it. Stark makes this argument with ethnographic case studies of three companies attempting to cope with rapid change: a machine-tool company in late and postcommunist Hungary, a new-media startup in New York during and after the collapse of the Internet bubble, and a Wall Street investment bank whose trading room was destroyed on 9/11. In each case, the friction of competing criteria of worth promoted an organizational reflexivity that made it easier for the company to change and deal with market uncertainty. Drawing on John Dewey's notion that "perplexing situations" provide opportunities for innovative inquiry, Stark argues that the dissonance of diverse principles can lead to discovery.},

Often there exist features that are locally translation invariant and would be valuable for directing the model's attention, but previous attentional architectures are not constructed to learn such features specifically. We introduce an attentional neural network that employs convolution on the input tokens to detect local time-invariant and long-range topical attention features in a context-dependent way. We apply this architecture to the problem of extreme summarization of source code snippets into short, descriptive function name-like summaries. Using those features, the model sequentially generates a summary by marginalizing over two attention mechanisms: one that predicts the next summary token based on the attention weights of the input tokens and another that is able to copy a code token as-is directly into the summary. We demonstrate our convolutional attention neural network's performance on 10 popular Java projects showing that it achieves better performance compared to previous attentional mechanisms.},

And when the combined value of the millions of items that only sell in small quantities equals or even exceeds the value of a handful of best-sellers?In this ground-breaking book, Chris Anderson shows that the future of business does not lie in hits - the high-volume end of a traditional demand curve - but in what used to be regarded as misses - the endlessly long tail of that same curve. As our world is transformed by the Internet and the near infinite choice it offers consumers, so traditional business models are being overturned and new truths revealed about what consumers want and how they want to get it. Chris Anderson first explored the Long Tail in an article in Wired magazine that has become one of the most influential business essays of our time. Now, in this eagerly anticipated book, he takes a closer look at the new economics of the Internet age, showing where business is going and exploring the huge opportunities that exist: for new producers, new e-tailers, and new tastemakers. He demonstrates how long tail economics apply to industries ranging from the toy business to advertising to kitchen appliances. He sets down the rules for operating in a long tail economy. And he provides a glimpse of a future that's already here.},
