  abstract = {Accounts of ‘biocapital’ abound in studies of the contemporary biosciences. However, these have tended to pay attention to the use and consumption of biological knowledge rather than the means and conditions of the production of data. This article draws on an ethnographic account of a high-throughput genomics laboratory (the Eli and Edythe L. Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA) to show how the means through which biological data is produced exerts a determinative effect on the kind of knowledge that is generated by the laboratory. High-speed, high-volume, high-efficiency production of data requires the high-throughput consumption of data by statistical and computational techniques. These techniques, in turn, generate general, broad-scale accounts of biological systems, rather than particular knowledge about individual genes or biological components. This cycle of production and consumption is described as ‘bioinformatics’ in order to indicate the centrality of computers and computing to the knowledge production process in contemporary biology.},

  abstract = {This editorial uses articles published in recent issues of Health, Risk and Society to critically review current approaches to risk communication. The effective communication of risk forms a key component of public health measures designed to improve the health of populations in countries such as the UK. These approaches assume that the recipients of the risk information are rational actors who will use the information to minimize their exposure to health hazards, and this will reduce the collective level of harm. However, a recent article in Health, Risk and Society indicated that individuals are not passive recipients of information and do not respond to risk information 'rationally'. Individuals actively engage in looking for and using information but may also make conscious decisions to avoid certain forms of information. Their response to information is shaped by social context, their own needs for personal security and the extent to which they trust the source of specific items of information. As a result, there is little evidence that risk communication based on the rational actor model shapes an understanding or behaviour in ways in which health-policy makers and public health experts want.},

  abstract = {Social science research into online health groups often studies characteristics of Internet communication, such as anonymity and ability to connect individuals across distance, which facilitate unique modes of support between people with similar illnesses. This article compares discussion in an online group for people with a genetic susceptibility for deep vein thrombosis with offline interviews with individuals with the same condition. Active participants in the online group were mostly acutely or chronically ill, and the intense discussion revolved around the use of anticoagulant medications with potentially serious side-effects. Most of the individuals interviewed offline were healthy and described themselves as 'blase' about the condition, even if they were sometimes poorly informed. The findings indicate that online groups do indeed support their members but the support may focus on specific practices, such as the use of drugs. Drawing on multi-sited ethnography this article suggests studying online groups in relation to other possible ways of relating to health. Discerning what kinds of health identities and practices online groups cultivate is particularly important when investigating new 'at risk' conditions, which open up a broad range of possible identities and preventive actions.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the concept of 'risk-medicine' through the analysis of the rejection of prenatal screening among ultra Orthodox Jews in Israel. The foundations of this phenomenon are examined, defining 'risk' as a major socio-cultural feature of late modern Western society. The authors describe eight possible components of resistance to biomedicine, some being specifically applicable to risk-medicine: cultural discrepancy, lack of information, religious prohibitions, risk-aversion, incompatible health and illness cosmologies, fear and mistrust, governmental control, and irreconcilable epistemological differences. The analysis identifies two fundamental dimensions associated with risk-medicine: its epistemological basis, and the governmental surveillance that it involves. While the former stems from diverging conceptions on the values of different forms of 'gnosis' (probabilities vs. certainty) the latter draws upon the relationship between the state and risk-medicine, portraying ultra Orthodox women's rejection of prenatal screening as a form of resistance to nationalist, secular forces. The paper advances new concepts (namely 'risk-medicine' and 'gnosis' as related to 'pro-gnosis' and 'dia-gnosis') that may constitute a ground for further research on forms of medical epistemologies and practices and their related forms of resistance, namely in the context of religious and ideological incompatibilities.},

  shorttitle = {From Authority to Authenticity},
  abstract = {In this paper, we suggest that the basis on which risk is publicly managed is presently in a process of transition from the demonstration of expert authority to that of public authenticity. That is, in today's contexts of contested trust, the achievement of an authentic persona has become an increasingly important representational objective for both institutions and individuals involved in risk management. The paper draws empirically on a recent controversy in biotechnology, xenotransplantation, the transplantation of tissues from animals to humans. Drawing on this case, we consider not only how risk is assessed (in the loose sense of weighing up, formally or informally, the risks and benefits associated with a particular development), but also how the riskiness of risk assessment is itself contained. That is to say, we explore how various actors engage not only, in one way or another, with the 'calculation of risks' associated with xenotransplantation, but also with the risks entailed in calculating risks, or what we might call 'meta-risk'. This meta-risk can be seen as an index of the erosion of scientific authority in the context of 'world risk society'. We suggest that one means of waylaying such meta-risk is the demonstration of 'transparency' in the process of rendering risk assessments. However, 'transparency' is itself highly problematic, not least because the criteria that make a decision-making process (such as risk assessment) 'transparent' are always open to query. Indeed, far from being a solution to the crisis in trust, it is very likely that we will see an additional crisis in transparency. We therefore examine our data in terms of the means by which the assessment of risk is 'anchored' and the need for further interrogation obviated. We suggest that the problems of 'meta-risk' and transparency are rhetorically waylaid by representations of authenticity, crucially signed by what we shall call the 'performance of suffering'. Drawing on recent work in the sociology of institutions and emotions, we suggest that there are emerging conventions by which 'suffering' evokes 'authenticity' in the effort to reach a decision (or assess a risk) and that this 'authenticity' is replacing 'authority' as the means by which a decision (or risk assessment) is rhetorically warranted.},

We compare the complex and widely different 'trust profiles' of two regulatory organisations which are institutionally related ( the Health and Safety Executive and the Railways Inspectorate) but very separate in the minds of our participants. The paper develops the notion of critical trust to interrogate the various ways in which people make sense of such organisations, as well as discussing the modes of reasoning that people deploy.

  abstract = {Despite the many designs of devices operating with the DNA strand displacement, surprisingly none is explicitly devoted to the implementation of logical deductions. The present article introduces a new model of biosensor device that uses nucleic acid strands to encode simple rules such as “IF DNA \_ strand1 is present THEN diseaseA” or “IF DNA \_ strand1 AND DNA \_ strand2 are present THEN diseaseB”. Taking advantage of the strand displacement operation, our model makes these simple rules interact with input signals (either DNA or any type of RNA) to generate an output signal (in the form of nucleotide strands). This output signal represents a diagnosis, which either can be measured using FRET techniques, cascaded as the input of another logical deduction with different rules, or even be a drug that is administered in response to a set of symptoms. The encoding introduces an implicit error cancellation mechanism, which increases the system scalability enabling longer inference cascades with a bounded and controllable signal–noise relation. It also allows the same rule to be used in forward inference or backward inference, providing the option of validly outputting negated propositions (e.g. “diagnosis A excluded”). The models presented in this paper can be used to implement smart logical DNA devices that perform genetic diagnosis in vitro.},

  volume = {9},
  doi = {10.1080/13698570601181573},
  abstract = {With over 500 prenatal genetic tests currently available, and many more entering the consumer medical market each year, prenatal genetic testing is rapidly becoming routine practice in the medical management of pregnancy. The greatest benefits gained from prenatal genetic testing are the prevention of the birth of a child with a chronic genetic disease and offering prospective parents a degree of liberation from reproductive risk. These benefits are, however, tempered by a series of complex ethical, legal and social risks, which must be identified and managed if the benefits are to be maximized. The aim of this paper is to investigate how a group of experts in human genetics perceive the origin and impact of these risks. Based on a qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with experts in the new genetics, seven risks are identified. These include: the risk of state intervention into private lives and the consequent loss in reproductive freedom, the risk of coercive testing emerging from medical paternalism; the risk of ambivalence in knowing whether prenatal testing should be offered for all conditions, or only for severe medical conditions; the risk prenatal testing will amplify existing racial, sexual and disability discrimination; the risk prospective parents will develop inflated expectations of genetic perfectionism; the risk of inequalities in access to genetics counselling and testing services, and the risk of fostering an increase in wrongful birth and wrongful life litigation. The findings of this study have implications for enhancing genetic risk-management policies and for improving the delivery of genetic testing services. They also have implications for advancing our understanding of the relationship between genetic health, genetic risk and society.},

The cost of electronic health records, imaging, and microbial, immunological, and behavioral data are also dropping quickly.

In this article we present findings from our qualitative research on a group of Australians' risk knowledges and experiences, using in-depth interviews to explore the meanings given to risk and the discourses used to express ideas about risk. We focus here on what our interviewees had to say about their experiences of, and views about, voluntary risk-taking. We identify and discuss three dominant discourses in our interviewees' accounts: those of self-improvement, emotional engagement and control. Our conclusion relates these discourses to wider discourses and notions about subjectivity and embodiment.},

  abstract = {In this editorial, I introduce the first in a new series of special issues on social theoretical perspectives towards risk and uncertainty. These will appear annually, with each issue addressing a specific theoretical or conceptual theme, or problem, pertaining to social scientific studies of risk and uncertainty. The articles included in this first collection are intended to demonstrate variation in the field of social theories of risk and uncertainty, though each of the articles speaks in different ways to concerns regarding the legitimacy of risks and/or policies oriented to risk. This editorial introduces the four contributions in the special issue, while also considering some broader dimensions of legitimacy as a means of locating some cross-cutting themes that connect the articles and their respective theoretical orientations. I outline a framework by which different configurations of risk, authority and consensus are considered in their generation of legitimacy, or in the lack thereof. Risks can form the basis of effective governance by existing authorities in line with general consensus (authority + consensus = legitimate risk), notions of risk can be harnessed by existing authorities to foster consensus (authority + risk = legitimate consensus), invoking notions of risk in line with popular consensus can bolster authority (consensus + risk = legitimate authority), but 'risks' with neither consensus nor links to authority fail to become legitimate. These primary understandings are developed and nuanced further by the four articles, in an array of theoretical directions. The editorial closes by looking towards the Risk and Social Theory special issue for 2015, which will focus on theories of risk and uncertainty in non-Western contexts.},

  shorttitle = {Towards a Better Understanding of Risk-Taking},
  abstract = {The current study of risk is dominated by the risk minimisation approach that frames risk and risk-taking as something undesirable that should be avoided as much as possible. However, this approach to risk often fails to consider the broader conditions and motivations of risk-taking and to examine why people expose themselves to danger. In this editorial, I explore two key concepts - voluntary risk-taking and risk behaviour - considering the ways in which they represent opposing views in risk studies. I make the case for a broader approach to 'risk-taking' that addresses the complex tensions between risk-taking and risk aversion in the social, natural and material contexts of everyday life. I examine how risk-taking is characterised by varying degrees of control over decision-making, different mixes of motives, the impact of socio-structural factors, forms of routinisation and habitual risk-taking, how power is involved in risk-taking and how identity is used to challenge experts' views. I discuss the role of stigma in risk-taking and how general societal contexts and organisational cultures influence the risk-taking. While there is increasing research on risk-taking, there is still scope for further publications that will advance our understanding of risk-taking in its social contexts, and in this editorial, I address issues that will form the basis of a forthcoming special issue of Health, Risk \& Society.},

  abstract = {Influenza viruses are radically uncertain, leading to scientific and procedural challenges for diagnosis and surveillance and lending influenza symptoms a high degree of indeterminacy. In time of pandemic influenza, however, members of the general public are asked to enact non-pharmaceutical infection control measures such as hygiene and social distancing. Drawing on the concepts of manufactured risk and ontological insecurity, we use data from interviews and focus groups we undertook in 2011 and 2012 in Melbourne, Sydney and Glasgow, to examine how members of the general public understood the 'fuzzy' nature of the influenza virus and reconciled this with infection control measures. We found that participants in our research acknowledged: the difficulty of avoiding infection from influenza; impediments to accurate diagnosis and that infection control measures proposed by public health messages were compromised by the 'fuzzy' nature of the virus. However, we found that participants valued prevention measures, not necessarily because they were seen to be effective, but because they supplied security in the face of influenza's uncertainties and the wider proliferation of daily and biographical risks.},

There is much discussion of the validity, benefits and risks of this testing, and its ethics and regulation, but little information about the experiences of those who have purchased this testing. This paper offers an autobiographical ethnography, describing the author's use of genome scans purchased from deCODEme and 23andMe. The genetic disease risks provided were generally very modest and there were significant variations in the risks from the two companies. Risks were skeptically interpreted through a frame of knowledge of family disease histories. It is suggested that this personal medicine is likely to disappoint and it does not live up to its claims. Rather than being empowering personalized medicine, these scans are a geneticized medicine of the genomic person.},

We use case studies of the Open Web, Facebook, and Google to demonstrate that infrastructure studies provides a valuable approach to the evolution of shared, widely accessible systems and services of the type often provided or regulated by governments in the public interest. On the other hand, platform studies captures how communication and expression are both enabled and constrained by new digital systems and new media. In these environments, platform-based services acquire characteristics of infrastructure, while both new and existing infrastructures are built or reorganized on the logic of platforms. We conclude by underlining the potential of this combined framework for future case studies.},

  abstract = {Online genetic testing services are increasingly being offered to consumers who are becoming exposed to, and knowledgeable about, new kinds of genetic technologies, as the launch of a 23andme genetic testing product in the UK testifies. Genetic research breakthroughs, cheek swabbing forensic pathologists and celebrities discovering their ancestral roots are littered throughout the North American, European and Australasian media landscapes. Genetic testing is now capturing the attention, and imagination, of hundreds of thousands of people who can not only buy genetic tests online, but can also go online to find relatives, share their results with strangers, sign up for personal DNA-based musical scores, and take part in research. This book critically examines this market of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing from a social science perspective, asking, what happens when genetics goes online?  With a focus on genetic testing for disease, the book is about the new social arrangements which emerge when a traditionally clinical practice (genetic testing) is taken into new spaces (the internet). It examines the intersections of new genetics and new media by drawing from three different fields: internet studies; the sociology of health; and science and technology studies.  While there has been a surge of research activity concerning DTC genetic testing, particularly in sociology, ethics and law, this is the first scholarly monograph on the topic, and the first book which brings together the social study of genetics and the social study of digital technologies. This book thus not only offers a new overview of this field, but also offers a unique contribution by attending to the digital, and by drawing upon empirical examples from our own research of DTC genetic testing websites (using online methods) and in-depth interviews in the United Kingdom with people using healthcare services.},

The DTAB-coated E7 (used LC mixture) in the TEM grid (TEMDTAB) exhibited a homeotropic orientation, and changed to a planar orientation upon adsorption of the ssDNAprobe. The TEMDTAB/DNA was then exposed to complementary (target) ssDNA, which resulted in a planar-to-homeotropic configurational change of E7 that could be observed through a polarized optical microscope under crossed polarizers. The optimum adsorption density (2 μM) of ssDNAprobe enabled the detection of ≥0.05 nM complementary ssDNA. This TEMDTAB/DNA biosensor could differentiate complementary ssDNA from mismatched ssDNA as well as double-stranded DNA. It also successfully detected the genomic DNAs of the bacterium Erwinia carotovora and the fungi Rhazictonia solani.

  abstract = {A phenome-wide association study of variants in genes in the Th17 and IL-17 pathway was performed using self-reported phenotypes and genetic data from 521,000 research participants of 23andMe. Results replicated known associations with similar effect sizes for autoimmune traits illustrating self-reported traits can be a surrogate for clinically assessed conditions. Novel associations controlling for a false discovery rate of 5\% included the association of the variant encoding p.Ile684Ser in TYK2 with increased risk of tonsillectomy, strep throat occurrences and teen acne, the variant encoding p.Arg381Gln in IL23R with a decrease in dandruff frequency, the variant encoding p.Asp10Asn in TRAF3IP2 with risk of male-pattern balding, and the RORC regulatory variant (rs4845604) with protection from allergies. This approach enabled rapid assessment of association with a wide variety of traits and investigation of traits with limited reported associations to overlay meaningful phenotypic context on the range of conditions being considered for drugs targeting this pathway.},

  abstract = {This paper explores two reddit communities that supported Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, respectively, in the run up to the 2016 US Presidential election campaign. Much of the paper is dedicated to explaining how reddit functions, describing the behaviour of the subreddit communities in question and then asking whether these demonstrated collective intelligence. Subreddit communities submit and vote on content, through their votes they make collective decisions about which content will be broadcast to their community. Large subreddit communities that formed rapidly to support a candidate in an election have not previously been observed on reddit—these offered an interesting context for the consideration of whether subreddit communities demonstrate collective intelligence. Voting is a key determinant of what happens on each subreddit and it is conducted anonymously, it is, therefore, not possible to understand the role(s) that every individual plays in the functioning of the subreddit. The behaviour of these subreddit communities can only be understood as a collective of submitting, commenting, voting and moderating participants. Whether these collectives behave intelligently is a matter of how one defines intelligence—but it is clear that they can be effective in pursuing certain ends. These collectives encounter and sometimes oppose each other on reddit. The community of Trump supporters in particular were in conflict with a number of other high-profile communities on the site, and also the platform’s administrators.},

In order to identify the genes involved in such traits, we administered Web-based surveys to the customer base of 23andMe, a personal genetics company. Upon completion of surveys, participants were able to see how their answers compared to those of other customers. Our examination of 22 different common traits in nearly 10,000 participants revealed associations among several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, a type of common DNA sequence variation) and freckling, hair curl, asparagus anosmia (the inability to detect certain urinary metabolites produced after eating asparagus), and photic sneeze reflex (the tendency to sneeze when entering bright light). Additionally our analysis verified the association of a large number of previously identified genes with variation in hair color, eye color, and freckling. Our analysis not only identified new genetic associations, but also showed that our novel way of doing research—collecting self-reported data over the Web from involved participants who also receive interpretations of their genetic data—is a viable alternative to traditional methods.},

  abstract = {We explored the characteristics and motivations of people who, having obtained their genetic or genomic data from Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) companies, voluntarily decide to share them on the publicly accessible web platform openSNP. The study is the first attempt to describe open data sharing activities undertaken by individuals without institutional oversight. In the paper we provide a detailed overview of the distribution of the demographic characteristics and motivations of people engaged in genetic or genomic open data sharing. The geographical distribution of the respondents showed the USA as dominant. There was no significant gender divide, the age distribution was broad, educational background varied and respondents with and without children were equally represented. Health, even though prominent, was not the respondents’ primary or only motivation to be tested. As to their motivations to openly share their data, 86.05\% indicated wanting to learn about themselves as relevant, followed by contributing to the advancement of medical research (80.30\%), improving the predictability of genetic testing (76.02\%) and considering it fun to explore genotype and phenotype data (75.51\%). Whereas most respondents were well aware of the privacy risks of their involvement in open genetic data sharing and considered the possibility of direct, personal repercussions troubling, they estimated the risk of this happening to be negligible. Our findings highlight the diversity of DTC-GT consumers who decide to openly share their data. Instead of focusing exclusively on health-related aspects of genetic testing and data sharing, our study emphasizes the importance of taking into account benefits and risks that stretch beyond the health spectrum. Our results thus lend further support to the call for a broader and multi-faceted conceptualization of genomic utility.},

  abstract = {People keep track. In the eighteenth century, Benjamin Franklin kept charts of time spent and virtues lived up to. Today, people use technology to self-track: hours slept, steps taken, calories consumed, medications administered. Ninety million wearable sensors were shipped in 2014 to help us gather data about our lives. The term quantified self (popularized by journalist Gary Wolf) refers to how people record, analyze, and reflect on this data, as well as to the tools they use and the communities they become part of. This book describes what happens when people turn their everyday experience—in particular, health and wellness-related experience—into data, and offers an introduction to the essential ideas and key challenges of the quantified self. Gina Neff and Dawn Nafus consider the quantified self as a social and cultural phenomenon, describing not only the use of data as a kind of mirror of the self but also how the quantified self enables users to connect to, and learn from, others.

Neff and Nafus consider what’s at stake when we quantify ourselves—who wants our data and why; the practices of serious self-tracking enthusiasts; the design of commercial self-tracking technology; and how self-tracking can fill gaps in the healthcare system. Today, no one can lead an entirely unquantified life. Neff and Nafus show us how to use data in a way that empowers and educates.},

  abstract = {Objectives The aim of the study was to evaluate the ability of a novel web and mobile application to identify a woman's ovulation day and fertile window, in order to use it as a method of natural birth control.Methods A retrospective study was performed on 1501 cycles of 317 women aged 18 to 39 years. Women entered their basal body temperatures, ovulation test results and date of menstruation into the application.Results The mean delay from the first positive ovulation test to the temperature-based estimation of the ovulation day was 1.9 days; the length of the luteal phase varied on average by 1.25 days per user. Only 0.05\% of non-fertile days were falsely attributed and found within the fertile window.Conclusions The method is effective at identifying a user's ovulation day and fertile window and can therefore be used as a natural method of birth control.Chinese Abstract摘要目的：本研究的目的为评估一个新的网页及移动设备应用鉴别女性排卵日和生育窗的能力，以便将其用于指导自然避孕。方法：年龄在18至37岁的317名妇女的1501个月经周期被纳入了回顾性研究。受试者将基础体温、排卵测试结果和经期输入至此应用。结果：首次排卵阳性日至基础体温预计排卵日的平均延迟时间为1.9天；平均每个受试者的黄体期时间变化大约为1.25天。只有0.05\%的非生育期被错误地归至生育窗。结论：此方法可有效识别使用者排卵日及生育窗，因此可应用于自然避孕。关键词自然生育控制，生育窗，自然避孕，生育力认知，基础体温，排卵监测},

  abstract = {Relatedness is a fundamental concept in genetics but is surprisingly hard to define in a rigorous yet useful way. Traditional relatedness coefficients specify expected genome sharing between individuals in pedigrees, but actual genome sharing can differ considerably from these expected values, which in any case vary according to the pedigree that happens to be available. Nowadays, we can measure genome sharing directly from genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data; however, there are many such measures in current use, and we lack good criteria for choosing among them. Here, we review SNP-based measures of relatedness and criteria for comparing them. We discuss how useful pedigree-based concepts remain today and highlight opportunities for further advances in quantitative genetics, with a focus on heritability estimation and phenotype prediction.},
